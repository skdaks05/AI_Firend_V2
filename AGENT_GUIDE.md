# Agent Integration Guide

The integration guide has moved into the official docs site content.

- English: [`web/content/en/guide/integration.md`](./web/content/en/guide/integration.md)
- Korean: [`web/content/ko/guide/integration.md`](./web/content/ko/guide/integration.md)

## Quick Start

In the target project root:

```bash
bunx oh-my-ag
bunx oh-my-ag doctor
```

This is the current recommended flow for safe integration without manually copying each folder.
