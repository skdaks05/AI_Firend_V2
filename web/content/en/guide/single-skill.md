# Use Case: Single Skill

## Scenario

You need a narrow scope result (for example, one component or one endpoint).

## Prompt Example

```text
Create a login form with Tailwind CSS and validation.
```

## Expected Flow

1. A single relevant skill is selected
2. Agent returns direct implementation
3. You iterate with small follow-ups

## Tips

- Specify stack and constraints explicitly
- Ask for tests when behavior is critical
- Keep the first request narrow
